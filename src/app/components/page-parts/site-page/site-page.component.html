          is a Fortune 500 company that provides cable TV, internet, telephone

        <p>
          I lead a team of developers maintaining parts of the residential and
          small to medium business websites. I deal primarily with the buy-flow
          purchasing aspects of acquiring or upgrading services.

          <p class="title">Leadership</p>
          <p>
            I have led teams of between 2 and 8 developers through the entire
            development life-cycle, successfully completing many high-priority
            projects meeting very tight deadlines.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also developed a series of tools to use in our interview system
            and paricipated in all stages of the process, from assessing resumes
            to deep technical reviews.
          </p>

          <p class="title">Ingenuity</p>
          <p>
            Thinking beyond writing code, I pioneered a development process and
            related documentation to avoid churn between departments, and help
            the devs & QE's operate from a single source of truth.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="title">Quality</p>
          <p>
            Being able to design complex, long-term solutions, I helped
            architect a JSON based CMS system to allow us to make changes to
            copy, images, and page layouts in a much shorter time frame using a
            less restrictive pipeline.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system was adopted throughout our department and continues to
            serve as the foundation for new work.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="title">Flexibility</p>
          <p>
            Operating in a rapidly changing environment, I worked with a large
            enterprise application through several restructurings including a
            monorepo and micro-front-ends.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="title">Passion</p>
          <p>
            Taking pride in my work, I was a multiple-time internal award winner
            for excellence in work and going above and beyond.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p class="title">Motivation</p>
          <p>
            I was converted from a contractor to a full-time employee, promoted
            from Mid to Senior software engineer, and then promoted to Lead of a
            team of developers.

          I designed, built, and hosted the site while helping my friend learn

          The Events and Specials pages are populated from AWS S3 buckets, and

          I designed and built the UI, and helped with some of the backend

          The system was built to allow login-less use while still maintaining

          I built the animated grid for the main page and integrated it into a
